## computer version project

This repository contains a variety of practice assignments for computer vision.

LAB1, consists mainly of rotating a picture and changing the RBG channel of the picture.

Prelab2 and LAB2 mainly consist of operations to change the grayscale value of the picture and colorize the picture, practicing the application of Kmean algorithm in image processing.

The main content of LAB3 and prelab3 is to find the circular shape in the image.

LAB4 and prelab4 implement image grabbing. For example placing the front side of a slanted box to the horizontal plane.

LAB5 and prelab5 implement the algorithm for Epipolar Geometry.

The final project is to combine many cropped images into a panoramic image by finding common features.
